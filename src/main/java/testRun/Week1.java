//when you want something private (Access modifiers) you can do a private method, but its limited only to the class,
//so instead of public or default you start it as private void objectName(){}
//anything private should be in your Main class since that's where you run everything

//Protected Access Modifier class is not exposed to others.  It's similar to private and limited to the class its written in.
// Also, It's similar to default access modifier with one exception that its has visibility in sub classes.
